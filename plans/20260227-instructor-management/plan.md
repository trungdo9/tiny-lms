## Implementation

### Phase 1: Course Management
**`/frontend/app/(instructor)/courses/`**

1. **List page** (`page.tsx`)
   - Table of instructor's courses
   - Columns: Title, Status, Lessons, Students, Actions
   - Actions: Edit, Delete, Clone

2. **Create/Edit page** (`[id]/page.tsx` or `create/page.tsx`)
   - Form: Title, Description, Thumbnail, Status
   - Sections management (add/remove/reorder)
   - Lessons management (add/remove/reorder within sections)

3. **Delete** - Confirm dialog, call DELETE API

4. **Clone** - POST to `/courses` with cloned data

### Phase 2: Quiz Management
**`/frontend/app/(instructor)/quizzes/`**

1. **List page** (`page.tsx`)
   - Table of quizzes with course info
   - Actions: Edit, Delete, Clone, View Reports

2. **Create/Edit page** (`[id]/page.tsx`)
   - Form: Title, Description, Course, Time limit, Passing score
   - Pagination mode, shuffle settings
   - Question selection from banks

3. **Delete** - Confirm dialog, call DELETE API

4. **Clone** - POST to `/quizzes` with cloned data

### Phase 3: Question Management
**`/frontend/app/(instructor)/question-banks/[id]/`**

1. **List questions** (update existing)
   - Table with question preview
   - Actions: Edit, Delete

2. **Edit question modal/page**
   - All question fields
   - Options management

3. **Delete** - Confirm, call DELETE API

### Phase 4: Backend Clone Endpoints (if needed)
- POST `/courses/clone/:id`
- POST `/quizzes/clone/:id`

Or handle clone on frontend by fetching data and POSTing to create.

## Files to Create/Modify
